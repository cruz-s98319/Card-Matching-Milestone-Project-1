# Card-Matching-Milestone-Project-1

For the first milestone project, I was deciding between a couple of old school games such as the snake game, tic tac toe, and a memory card game. I decided to go with the memory card game as I thought that it would be the best way to utilize simple Javascript for the mechanics and put emphasis on the CSS as out of the two languages, I am more comfortable with CSS.

I used a started code for HTML, CSS, and Javascript from ChatGPT.
