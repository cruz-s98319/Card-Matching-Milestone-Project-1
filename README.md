# Card-Matching-Milestone-Project-1

For the first milestone project, I was deciding between a couple of old school games such as the snake game, tic tac toe, and a memory card game. I decided to go with the memory card game as I thought that it would be the best way to utilize simple Javascript for the mechanics and put emphasis on the CSS as out of the two languages, I am more comfortable with CSS.

I used a started code for HTML, CSS, and Javascript from ChatGPT. Over time, I built on top of the starter code and also referenced a starter code from JavaScript Academy on Youtube/GitHub.
The link to JavaScript Academy is below:

For the card images, I used the character ability icon concepts for the game League of Legends created by Samuel Thompson. You will find these images on his artstation link below:

The image for the back of the cards is the Riot Games Team Fight Tactics mobile app icon created by T.J. Geisen. Below is the link to his artstation post for the image:
